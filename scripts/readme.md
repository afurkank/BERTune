# Scripts

You can download and run the scripts if you are not going to use the package.

You can either run the 'run_script.sh' scripts or directly use 'torchrun script.py --model_name ...' command
in terminal within the vecquery_tune/scripts directory. Don't forget to replace 'script' with the name of 
the script file you want to run.

Note: Running scripts is significantly faster than using the 'vecquery_tune' package.
